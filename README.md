# Pomodoro-Clock-
It is an extension built orignally by <b>macmorning</b> that I modified to my preferences.
The extension is really good. Infact, it is the best pomodoro extension for firefox that I have found.
But I had a few problems with it. Namely, I didn't like the light mode and the "?" button.

So, I changed it to have a dark mode, removed the "?" button.
I also changed the logo (I found the logo to be really ugly).

You can find the original extension here: https://github.com/macmorning/pomodoro-webext

This is what it looks like now.
