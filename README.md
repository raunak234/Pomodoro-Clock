# Pomodoro-Clock-
It is a modifed form of extension built orignally by macmorning to my preferences. 
I didn't like the light mode and the "?" button.
So, I changed it to have a dark mode, removed the "?" button.
I also changed the logo (I found the logo to be really ugly).

You can find the original extension here: https://github.com/macmorning/pomodoro-webext
